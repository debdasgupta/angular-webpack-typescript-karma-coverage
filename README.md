# angular-webpack-typescript-karma-coverage
An exemplary project using Angular 1.x, Webpack, TypeScript and Karma (with Coverage).

## How to run?
0. `npm install -g typings` (if you don't have them installed globally yet).
1. Clone the repository (i.e. `git clone https://github.com/zbicin/angular-webpack-typescript-karma-coverage.git && cd angular-webpack-typescript-karma-coverage`).
2. `npm install`.
3. `typings install`.
4. `npm start` to see the simple app running.
5. `npm test` to run karma and generate coverage tests. The latter are located in the `coverage/` directory.

## The most interesting parts:
1. `webpack.config.js` with `devtool` set to `inline-source-map`.
2. `webpack.config.karma.js` - slightly modified webpack config which is used exclusively by karma.
3. `karma.conf.js` using `source-map-support` framework and generating a json coverage report.
4. `tsconfig.json` with `inlineSourceMap` set to `true` and `sourceMap` set to `false`.
5. `remap-istanbul -i coverage/json/coverage-final.json -o coverage/html-ts -t html` being run by `npm test`. It generates an HTML report containing original TypeScript source files, basing on the json report generated by karma-coverage.
